## 1. Product Hunt Launch 😸
**Link**: [https://www.producthunt.com/posts/new](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/new)
**Time**: 12:01 AM PT

**Title**: Antigravity - Directory of Agentic AI Tools
**Tagline**: Curated directory of 50+ tools for building autonomous AI systems
**Description**: 
> I wasted 40+ hours researching AI coding tools, vector DBs, and agent frameworks. There was no single source of truth for the agentic stack.
>
> So I built **Antigravity** - a quality-focused directory for developers building autonomous systems.
>
> **Key Features:**
> 🔍 **Side-by-Side Comparisons**: Claude vs ChatGPT, Copilot vs Cursor
> 🛡️ **Verified Badges**: No affiliate spam, just high-quality tools
> 🤖 **Agentic Focus**: Dedicated categories for Agents, LLM APIs, and Vector DBs
>
> We launched with **50+ vetted tools** including Cursor, LangChain, Pinecone, and more.
>
> Would love your feedback! Which tools are we missing?

**First Comment**:
> Hey PH! 👋 I'm Suraj, creator of Antigravity.
>
> As a developer building agents, I found it impossible to keep up with the tool explosion. Is "AutoGPT" still the best? Which Vector DB scales cheapest?
>
> Antigravity solves this with curated listings and direct comparisons.
>
> **Launch Special**: All verified submissions get a permanent "Early Adopter" badge this week.
>
> let me know what you think!

## 2. Hacker News Launch 🍊
**Link**: [https://news.ycombinator.com/submit](https://news.ycombinator.com/submit)
**Time**: 8:00 AM PT

**Title**: Show HN: Antigravity – Directory for Agentic AI Development
**Url**: https://antigravity.directory
**Text**:
> I built a directory focused specifically on the "Agentic AI" stack (Coding Agents, Vector DBs, Frameworks).
>
> **Stack**: Next.js 15, Supabase, Vercel, Tailwind.
>
> **Why**: Most directories are filled with "AI Wrapper of the day" spam. I wanted a place for serious dev tools (LangChain, Pinecone, Cursor, etc.).
>
> It includes side-by-side comparisons (e.g., [Cursor vs Copilot](https://antigravity.directory/compare/copilot-vs-cursor)) to help with decision fatigue.
>
> Open to feedback on the categorization and any missing tools!

🚀 Launching Antigravity today - the definitive directory for agentic AI developers.

I wasted 40+ hours researching AI tools. No single source of truth existed.

So I built it.

dataset: 50+ vetted tools across 7 categories.

**Tweet 2**:
The problem: "AI Tool Directories" are flooded with low-quality wrappers.

Antigravity is different. We focus on the **Builder's Stack**:
✅ AI Coding Editors (Cursor, Copilot)
✅ Agent Frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI)
✅ Vector Databases (Pinecone, Weaviate)

**Tweet 3**:
Key Feature: **Comparison Engine** ⚖️

Don't just browse tools. Compare them.
• Claude 3 vs ChatGPT for coding
• Copilot vs Cursor
• LangChain vs LlamaIndex

Make informed decisions, fast.

**Tweet 4**:
For Builders 🛠️
- Discover tools before they trend
- Compare pricing & features
- verified quality (no spam)

For Founders 🚀
- Reach 10K+ targeted developers
- Get a high-quality Do-Follow backlink
- Launch promo: $49/lifetime listing

**Tweet 5 (End)**:
We're live on Product Hunt! 😸

**Content**:
> Hey everyone,
>
> I just launched [Antigravity](https://antigravity.directory), a directory specifically for the "Agentic AI" stack.
>
> **The Problem**: Too many "AI directories" listing 10,000 GPT wrappers. Hard to find actual dev tools.
> **The Solution**: A curated list of ~50 tools like Cursor, LangChain, Pinecone, etc.
>
> **Tech Stack**:
> - Next.js 15 (App Router)
> - Supabase (Postgres + Auth)
> - Vercel (Hosting)
> - Tailwind CSS
>
> I also built a comparison engine to pit tools against each other (e.g., Cursor vs Copilot).
>
> Would love your feedback on the UX and any tools I missed!

**Time**: 10:00 AM PT

🚀 Excited to launch **Antigravity** - a curated ecosystem for agentic AI development.

After spending weeks researching AI tools for client projects, I realized there's no authoritative source for the agentic stack.

So I built one.

**Antigravity features:**
✅ 50+ vetted tools (coding assistants, agent frameworks, vector DBs)
✅ Side-by-side comparisons (e.g., Claude vs ChatGPT)
✅ Quality over quantity (no affiliate spam)

**Perfect for:**
- Developers building autonomous systems
- Engineering teams evaluating AI tools
- Founders launching in the agentic space
