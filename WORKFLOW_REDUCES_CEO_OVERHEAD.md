**Before**: You're the middleman (high overhead)
**After**: You just review final status (low overhead)

## 📈 BEFORE (Old Workflow - With Slack)

         ↓
[REPEAT LOOP 5-10 times]

CEO OVERHEAD: HIGH ⚠️
- Reads Slack constantly
- Relays messages to Claude
- Relays feedback back to Antigravity
- Coordination overhead
- Time spent: 30-60 min/day
```

         ↓
Antigravity submits to REPORT-CENTER.md
         ↓

         ↓
Claude reviews in real-time
         ↓
Claude gives feedback (same chat)
         ↓
Antigravity fixes
         ↓

CEO OVERHEAD: LOW ✅
- Don't check Slack (nothing there)

```

---

## 📌 WHERE INFORMATION LIVES (Single Source of Truth)

**No more scattered files. Everything in one place.**

```
REPORT-CENTER.md
├─ Task Status (What's being worked on?)
├─ Deliverables (What was submitted?)
├─ PM Validation (What did Claude say?)
├─ Blockers (Any 🔴 issues?)
└─ Ralph Gate Status (Quality passing?)

That's it. One document. Check it daily.
```

---

## 💬 YOU DON'T NEED TO RELAY MESSAGES

**Old way** (you as middleman):
1. Antigravity: "Hey, I'm done with the plan"
2. CEO (you): "Claude, Antigravity is done"
3. Claude: "Review looks good, need X Y Z changes"
4. CEO (you): "Antigravity, Claude says..."
5. Antigravity: "OK fixing now"
6. [Loop repeats]

**New way** (direct collaboration):
1. Antigravity chats with Claude directly
2. Claude: "Review looks good, need X Y Z changes"
3. Antigravity: "Fixing now"
4. Claude: "Approved ✅"

**You just read the final status in REPORT-CENTER.md**

## 🎯 YOUR THREE JOBS (CEO)

### Job 1: Daily Status Check (5 min)
```

## ✅ HOW THIS REDUCES YOUR OVERHEAD

### 1. No Slack Checking
**Before**: Constantly checking Slack for updates
**After**: Only check REPORT-CENTER.md (once/day)

**Time saved**: 20 min/day = 2+ hours/week

---

### 2. No Message Relaying
**Before**: You relay between Antigravity & Claude
**After**: They communicate directly in chat

**Time saved**: 15 min/day = 1.5+ hours/week

---

### 3. Single Source of Truth
**Before**: Info scattered (Slack, emails, desktop files)
**After**: Everything in REPORT-CENTER.md

**Time saved**: 10 min/day for finding info = 1+ hour/week

---

### 4. Async Communication
**Before**: Need real-time responses
**After**: Claude reviews when Antigravity submits

**Time saved**: No waiting for callbacks

## 🚀 TODAY'S EXAMPLE

**Your involvement (as CEO)**:

```
9 AM: Antigravity starts reading documents
      (You don't do anything)

2 PM: Antigravity submits plan + Gate 0 log to REPORT-CENTER.md
      (You could check, but don't have to)

3 PM: Antigravity chats with Claude for real-time review
      (You don't need to be involved)

5 PM: Claude approves (or requests changes)
      (Antigravity handles fixes)

6 PM: You check REPORT-CENTER.md for 2 minutes
      Status: "Task submitted for review" → "PM approved ✅"

You're done. Move on with your day.
```

**Your time investment today**: 2 minutes

---

## 📋 YOUR STANDING INSTRUCTIONS

**Every day, do this (takes 5 min)**:

```
1. Open /docs/REPORT-CENTER.md
2. Check "CURRENT WEEK" section at top
3. Scan for 🔴 RED blockers or ✅ GREEN completions
4. If questions about a task, click into that section
5. Close the file, move on
```

**That's your job.**

Claude (PM) handles:
- ✅ Reviewing code quality
- ✅ Validating deliverables
- ✅ Approving/blocking work
- ✅ Tracking progress

Antigravity (Developer) handles:
- ✅ Doing the work
- ✅ Submitting to REPORT-CENTER.md
- ✅ Chatting with Claude for feedback
- ✅ Fixing issues

You (CEO) handle:
- ✅ Reviewing status daily (5 min)
- ✅ Making strategic decisions when needed
- ✅ Backing up PM when enforcing quality
- ✅ Approving final work for deployment

---

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE

**Before**: You were the middleman, managing communication
**After**: You're the executive, reviewing outcomes

**Before**: 10+ hours/month on coordination
**After**: ~2 hours/month on strategic review

**Before**: You had to stay on top of Slack constantly
**After**: You check one document once/day

**This is how real PM processes work.**

Claude manages the development. You manage the strategy. Everyone wins. 🚀

## 📞 WHAT TO DO NOW

1. ✅ Give Antigravity the single prompt: `ANTIGRAVITY_SINGLE_PROMPT_NO_SLACK.md`
2. ✅ Tell him: "Submit everything to REPORT-CENTER.md and chat with Claude"
3. ✅ Then forget about it for today
4. ✅ Check REPORT-CENTER.md once at end of day (5 min)
5. ✅ See the status, move on

**That's your entire job.**

The rest happens between Antigravity & Claude.
