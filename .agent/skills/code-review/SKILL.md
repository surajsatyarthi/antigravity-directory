# Code Review Skill

This skill enables the agent to perform comprehensive code reviews on the current workspace or specific files.

## Instructions

1.  **Analyze Context**: Understand the purpose of the changes by reading related documentation or task descriptions.
2.  **Check for Bugs**: Look for logical errors, edge cases, and potential runtime issues.
3.  **Style & Standards**: Ensure code follows established style guides (e.g., Airbnb, Google, or project-specific rules in `.agent/rules`).
4.  **Best Practices**: Identify opportunities for refactoring, performance improvements, and security hardening.
5.  **Constructive Feedback**: Provide clear, actionable comments with examples where possible.

## Examples

### Reviewing a specific file
"Review the changes in `src/utils/auth.ts` for any security vulnerabilities."

### Broad review
"Perform a code review on the latest commit and summarize major findings."
