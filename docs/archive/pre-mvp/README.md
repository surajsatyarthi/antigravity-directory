# ARCHIVED: Old Directory Model Documents

**Archive Date**: February 11, 2026
**Reason**: These documents describe a **paid submission directory model** that contradicts our **marketplace model**.

---

## ⚠️ DO NOT USE THESE DOCUMENTS

All documents in this folder are **OUTDATED** and **INCORRECT**.

They describe a business model where:
- ❌ Creators pay $49-$149 to submit/list resources
- ❌ Revenue comes from "paid listings"
- ❌ "Standard tier" vs "Featured tier" pricing

**This model was REJECTED.**

## ✅ USE THIS INSTEAD

**New Single Source of Truth**: [`/docs/MARKETPLACE_MODEL_SPEC.md`](../MARKETPLACE_MODEL_SPEC.md)

The marketplace model:
- ✅ Creators list resources **FREE**
- ✅ Creators earn **80% on sales**
- ✅ Platform takes **20% commission**
- ✅ Revenue from commissions + ads (not paid submissions)
