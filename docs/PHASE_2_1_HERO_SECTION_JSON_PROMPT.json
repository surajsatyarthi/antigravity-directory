  "context": {
    "problem": "Current hero section only emphasizes 'marketplace' with generic messaging. Users don't understand the THREE core value drivers of the site.",
    "solution": "Redesign hero using 'Rule of 3' copywriting principle. Present all three value propositions clearly in hero so users immediately understand what they get.",
    "impact": "Users see value instantly → faster conversion → more creator signups → more marketplace activity"
  },

  "rule_of_three": {
    "definition": "The Rule of 3 in copywriting states that things are more memorable, satisfying, and effective when presented in groups of three. Examples: 'Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness' / 'Stop, look, listen' / 'Fast, cheap, good (pick two)'",
    "why_it_works": "Three items feel complete. Two feels incomplete. Four feels cluttered. Three is the 'Goldilocks' of persuasive messaging.",
