# Phase 0 Implementation Plan (2026-02-03)

**Author**: Antigravity
**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Status**: AWAITING PM APPROVAL

## Problem Statement
Why do we need to scrape 1500+ MCP resources?

We need to rapidly populate the Antigravity directory with high-quality, relevant MCP resources to provide immediate value to users and establish market authority. Manual entry of 1500+ resources would be prohibitively slow (125+ hours), delaying our launch and revenue goals.

## Proposed Solution
How will the API scraper + validation + import work?

The solution involves a robust, FAANG-standard API scraper that identifies MCP tools via public APIs (e.g., GitHub), validates each entry for required data and integrity, and imports them into our database using safe transactions and batch operations. It will include comprehensive error handling, rate limiting, and 80%+ test coverage.

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Manual CSV Import
- **How it works**: Create CSV file, upload via admin UI
- **Pros**: Simple, no coding needed
- **Cons**: Takes 125+ hours manually
- **Why rejected**: Timeline too long, prone to human error, not repeatable for updates.

### Alternative 2: API Scraper (CHOSEN)
- **How it works**: Automated script finds tools, validates, imports
- **Pros**: Fast (2 hours), automated, repeatable, scalable, enforces quality via code.
- **Cons**: Requires initial development time and robust error handling for API variations.
- **Why chosen**: Fastest path to 1500+ resources, sustainable for long-term updates, aligns with engineering standards.

### Alternative 3: Database Sync
- **How it works**: Direct transfer from competitor database
- **Pros**: Fastest possible
- **Cons**: Legal/ethical concerns, potential for data quality issues, risk of being blocked.
- **Why rejected**: Not viable due to ethical and legal risks.

## Why API Scraper is Best
The API Scraper provides the optimal balance of speed, scalability, and quality control. It allows us to automate the discovery and validation process while remaining compliant with public API terms, ensuring a sustainable and professional data acquisition strategy that meets FAANG quality standards.

## Implementation Overview
1. Scrape 1500+ MCPs using GitHub Search/Repo APIs with rate limiting.
2. Validate all data (title, URL, category, etc.) against strict schemas.
3. Import to database using PostgreSQL transactions and batch updates (avoiding N+1).
4. Test and verify with Vitest (unit/integration) and Ralph Protocol (12/12 checks).

## Timeline
- Phase 0.1.1: Build scraper + test (0.4 weeks)
- Phase 0.1.2: Validate data (0.1 weeks)
- Phase 0.5: Cleanup + reporting (0.05 weeks)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 1500+ resources imported
- [ ] 0 null titles/descriptions
- [ ] 0 duplicate URLs
- [ ] Tests passing (80%+ coverage)
- [ ] Ralph scan: 12/12 checks passing
- [ ] Build: npm run build PASS
