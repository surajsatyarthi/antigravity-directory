## 📊 PATH TO $35K MRR

```
Phase 1 (Feb 4-14):    $1-2k MRR     (marketplace seed)
Phase 2 (Feb 17-21):   $8-15k MRR    (monetization launch)
Phase 3 (Feb 24+):     $25-35k MRR   (scale + channels)
Phase 4 (Mar 10+):     $35-50k MRR   (full monetization)
```

**Phase 2 is the critical inflection point** where marketplace moves from "seed data" to "profitable business."

---

## 🚫 WHAT NOT TO BUILD IN PHASE 2

Wait for Phase 3+:
- ❌ Chrome extension (Phase 3)
- ❌ Advanced SEO automation (Phase 3)
- ❌ Community features (posts, comments, discussions) (Phase 4)
- ❌ Sponsorship partnerships (Phase 4)
- ❌ Mobile app (Phase 5+)
- ❌ Advanced analytics (Phase 4)

**Stay focused**: Phase 2 = Creator earnings + monetization only.

---

## 💡 PHASE 2 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Foundation for monetization**
   - Features shipped in Phase 2 enable all future revenue
   - Creator dashboard → featured tier → premium features
   - Job board → sponsorships → display ads

2. **Use real data**
   - Phase 1 created real sales, real creators
   - Phase 2 builds on that reality (not fake data)
   - Metrics are meaningful now

3. **Lock in creators**
   - Featured profiles create stickiness
   - Earnings dashboard creates return visits
   - Job board creates network effects

4. **Prepare for scale**
   - Newsletter building (list = asset)
   - SEO via profiles (organic growth)
   - Job board = 2nd revenue stream

## 📞 IF PHASE 1 METRICS FAIL

**Scenario 1**: Only 20 creator claims (target: 40)
- **Action**: Improve outreach copy, re-send to 200+ creators
- **Timeline**: +3 days before Phase 2
- **Go-live**: Phase 2 delayed 1 week

**Scenario 2**: Only 2 purchases (target: 5)
- **Action**: Audit purchase flow, improve homepage CTA
- **Timeline**: +2-3 days before Phase 2
- **Go-live**: Phase 2 delayed 3-5 days

**Scenario 3**: $50 revenue (target: $100+)
- **Action**: Combine above + pricing research
- **Timeline**: +5 days before Phase 2
- **Go-live**: Phase 2 delayed 5-7 days

**No matter what**: Phase 2 is the next step. Phase 1 failure just delays launch by days.
