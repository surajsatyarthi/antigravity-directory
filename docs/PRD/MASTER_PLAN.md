# Master Plan: Agentic Resource Hub (V16.0 - Hardened)

# Strategic Master Plan: Antigravity Directory (V17.0)

## 🎯 The North Star Metric

**Objective**: Achieve **$10,000 Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)** by Month 12.
**Purpose**: Financial independence and job-replacement for the founder.

## 💼 Executive Thesis: Profit-First Authority

We are not building a library; we are building a **High-Margin Lead Generation and Placement Engine.**
The "Authority" and "Verification" are merely the **moats** that allow us to charge premium prices for:

1. **Featured Visibility**: $299/mo per listing for high-intent traffic.
2. **Featured Placements**: $99/mo for standard growth.
3. **Data Arbitrage**: Selling high-intent traffic to AI dev-tool companies.

To become the definitive, high-authority independent hub for agentic resources (prompts, rules, and MCP servers), prioritizing developer trust and project sustainability over short-term "hacks."

### 5.1. Bootstrapped Ingestion Strategy (The Growth Hack)

Recognizing our bootstrapped status, we utilize **Smart Scraping** as our primary Q1 fuel:

### 5.2. Compliance & Operations

- **Privacy**: GDPR/CCPA Ready (Easy opt-out/Data deletion).
- **Branding**: "Agentic Resource Hub" - Independent metadata layer.
- **Moderation**: Human-in-the-loop review for all community submissions.
- **Team**: Solo Founder operation.
  - **AM**: SEO/pSEO maintenance.
  - **PM**: Sourcing partners/Manual job seeding.
