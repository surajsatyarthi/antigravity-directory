## 💡 Core Philosophy

### **We Are a Marketplace, Like Gumroad**
- Creators list **FREE**
- Creators earn **80%** on sales
- Platform takes **20%** commission
- Revenue from **commissions + ads** (NOT paid submissions)

### **Why This Beats Competitors**

**vs. cursor.directory ($35k MRR)**:
- Same marketplace model, better creator incentives
- Same community approach, on-site retention
- Same SEO strategy, entity stacking

**vs. antigravity.codes (competitor)**:
- They have aggressive ads only → we have creator earnings
- They have Discord (off-site) → we have on-site profiles (SEO)
- They have directory UX → we have marketplace UX
