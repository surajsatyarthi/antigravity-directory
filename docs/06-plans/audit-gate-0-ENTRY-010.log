## Web Search 2: Payout Request System Best Practices

**Query**: "payout request system best practices minimum threshold payment methods 2026"
**Date**: 2026-02-13

### Key Findings

#### 2026 Payout Trends
- **Faster global rails**: Multi-rail orchestration and embedded payout experiences
- **AI-driven automation**: Automated payout processing and fraud detection
- **Modular infrastructure**: Flexible, region-specific payout systems
- **Source**: [Payments and Payouts Trends Defining 2026](https://payquicker.com/payments-and-payouts-trends-defining-2026/)

#### Best Practices

**Embedded Payout Experiences**:
- Users want payouts to feel like a natural part of the workflow
- Sellers see balances where they already manage orders
- Creators withdraw earnings where they already view performance
- **Source**: [State of Payouts in 2026](https://payquicker.com/payout-trends-2026/)

**Multiple Payment Methods**:
- Users want the method that works locally, not the finance team's preference
- Enterprises prioritize flexibility and cost control
- Align payout methods to payee preference, corridor performance, and settlement speed
- **Source**: [State of Payouts in 2026](https://payquicker.com/payout-trends-2026/)

**Compliance Integration**:
- Global payout operations face increasing AML and KYC requirements
- Region-specific compliance checks are mandatory
- Compliance must be built-in from the start, not bolted on
- **Source**: [5 Key Payment Processor Regulations](https://theretailexec.com/payment-processing/payment-processor-regulations/)

#### Industry Minimum Thresholds
- **Twitch**: $50 USD (most methods), $100 USD (wire transfer)
- **Google AdSense**: $100 USD minimum payout
- **Alpha Futures**: $200 USD (Standard), $1,000 USD (Advanced)
- **Sources**: [Twitch Payout Threshold](https://www.streamscheme.com/twitch-payout-threshold/), [What Is A Payment Threshold?](https://dynuinmedia.com/what-is-a-payment-threshold/)

### Recommendations for ENTRY-010
1. **$10 USD minimum threshold** (lower than industry standard to encourage early payouts)
2. **Embedded experience**: Payout request modal within earnings dashboard
3. **Multiple payment methods**: Razorpay (India), PayPal (International) - already implemented
4. **Clear status tracking**: Show pending, processing, completed, rejected states
5. **Email notifications**: Notify creator AND admin on payout request (transparency + anti-fraud)

## Web Search 3: Commission Tracking & Earnings Breakdown

**Query**: "commission tracking earnings breakdown first sales free marketplace 2026"
**Date**: 2026-02-13

### Key Findings

#### Commission Tracking Software Features
- **Single source of truth**: Transform compensation from confusing admin to powerful motivator
- **Auto-calculation**: Automatically calculate profits, payouts, and commissions
- **Performance overview**: Clear visibility into rep performance and attainment
- **Sources**: [Best commission tracking software](https://monday.com/blog/crm-and-sales/commission-tracking-software/), [Sales Commission Tracking Template](https://www.notion.com/templates/commission-tracking-316)

#### Marketplace Commission Models
- **TikTok Shop Affiliate**: Creators earn commission on every sale they generate (marketplace model)
- **Atlassian Marketplace 2026**: 0% revenue share for first $1M in lifetime Forge revenue (first sales free!)
- **Sources**: [TikTok Shop Affiliate Guide](https://calculatecreator.com/blog/tiktok-shop-affiliate-beginners-guide/), [Atlassian Marketplace Revenue Share 2026](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/developer/updates-to-marketplace-revenue-share-2026)

### Critical Insight: Atlassian's "First Sales Free" Model
Atlassian announced in January 2026 that partners will pay **0% revenue share** for eligible Forge earnings, up to **$1 million in lifetime revenue**. This validates our "first 2 sales free" incentive structure as an industry-leading approach to attract creators.

### Earnings Breakdown Best Practices
1. **Transparent commission display**: Show creator percent vs platform percent on each sale
2. **Historical tracking**: Sales history table with commission breakdown per transaction
3. **Aggregate views**: Total earnings, total sales count, breakdown by commission tier
4. **Audit trail**: Immutable record of commission percentages applied (we already have this in `purchases.creatorPercent`)

---

## Design Decisions Based on Research

### 1. Earnings Overview Card
**Industry Pattern**: Patreon's multi-section dashboard
**Our Implementation**:
- Total earnings (aggregate)
- Sales count breakdown: "First 2 sales (100%)" vs "Sales 3+ (80%)"
- Pending payout amount
- Real-time updates (no caching)

**Rationale**: Transparent commission breakdown builds trust with creators

---

### 2. Sales History Table
**Industry Pattern**: Stripe's transaction list + ChopSuey's multi-source aggregation
**Our Implementation**:
- Paginated table (50 per page) with:
  - Resource name + link
  - Sale date
  - Price
  - Buyer username
  - Commission % (100% or 80%)
- Sort by date (newest first)

**Rationale**: Creators need detailed audit trail to verify earnings accuracy

---

### 3. Payout Request System
**Industry Pattern**: Twitch ($50 minimum) + Stripe's embedded payout flow
**Our Implementation**:
- $10 USD minimum threshold (lower barrier to first payout)
- Embedded modal (not separate page)
- Payment method selection (Razorpay/PayPal)
- Email notifications (creator + admin)
- Status tracking (pending, processing, completed, rejected)

**Rationale**: Lower threshold ($10 vs industry $50-$100) encourages early creator engagement

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks from Research

1. **Fraud/Abuse**: Low $10 threshold may encourage fake sales
   - **Mitigation**: Email admin on every payout request for manual review (MVP)
   - **Future**: Automated fraud detection (ENTRY-019+)

2. **Payment Method Complexity**: Multi-currency, multi-region compliance
   - **Mitigation**: Start with USD/INR only, Razorpay/PayPal only
   - **Future**: Add more regions/currencies based on creator demand

3. **Payout Delays**: Manual processing may frustrate creators
   - **Mitigation**: Set clear expectations (3-5 business days for manual review)
   - **Future**: Automated payouts for trusted creators (ENTRY-020+)

---

## Implementation Priorities (Gate 3 Input)

Based on research findings, prioritize in this order:

1. **Earnings Overview Card** (Core value prop - transparent commission breakdown)
2. **Sales History Table** (Audit trail - builds trust)
3. **Payout Request Modal** (Monetization unlock - enables creator withdrawal)

**Why this order?**
- Creators need to SEE earnings before they care about WITHDRAWING earnings
- Sales history provides proof/validation before requesting payout
- Payout modal is the final conversion step
