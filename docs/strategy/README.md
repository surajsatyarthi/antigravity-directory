## 💡 Core Philosophy

### Content is NOT a Moat
- Can scrape 1500+ MCPs in 2 days
- Can aggregate rules from anywhere
- Content is commodity

### Product + Community = The Real Moat
- Better UX (marketplace vs listing site)
- Social graph (retention)
- User profiles (SEO + validation)
- Chrome extension (DR 99 backlink)

### Why You'll Win vs antigravity.codes
1. **Better UX** - Marketplace model (Google) vs listing site (Yahoo)
2. **Better Community** - On-site profiles (SEO value) vs Discord (zero SEO)
3. **Better Monetization** - Tasteful ads (retention) vs aggressive ads (churn)
4. **Better SEO** - Entity stacking + DR 99 backlink = 3-5x more indexed pages
