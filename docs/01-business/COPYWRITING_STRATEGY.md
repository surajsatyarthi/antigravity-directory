- **Tone**: Empowering, direct, creator-focused
- **Not**: Corporate, stuffy, generic marketplace language
- **Instead**: "You can earn real money. Here's how."

### Example Copywriting Comparisons

❌ **Generic Directory**:
"Browse our curated collection of Antigravity tools"

✅ **Creator Marketplace**:
"Discover tools built by creators earning real income"

---

❌ **Generic**:
"List your tool to reach potential customers"

✅ **Creator-Focused**:
"List your tool and keep 80% of every sale"

---

❌ **Passive**:
"Tools are available for purchase"

✅ **Action-Oriented**:
"Earn $2,000+ monthly from your MCP"

---

## 7. REVENUE-CENTRIC MESSAGING

## 8. EARNINGS CALCULATOR

**Interactive component on `/create` page**:

```
INPUT: How many copies will you sell per month?
OUTPUT: "Here's what you could earn"

Scenario 1: 10 sales/month @ $49 = $392/month YOU earn
Scenario 2: 20 sales/month @ $49 = $784/month YOU earn
Scenario 3: 50 sales/month @ $49 = $1,960/month YOU earn
Scenario 4: 100 sales/month @ $49 = $3,920/month YOU earn

CALCULATION SHOWN:
$49 × 20 sales = $980 total revenue
÷ 80/20 split
= $784 for you, $196 for platform

## 9. NAVIGATION MENU COPY

### Current Navigation ❌
```
Home | Browse | MCPs | Rules | Workflows | Members | Jobs
```

### Revised Navigation ✅
```
Home | ✨ Create (Earn 80%) | Browse | Jobs | Community | [Post a Job]
```

**Rationale**:
- "✨ Create" is prominent (primary action for creators)
- "Earn 80%" inline (reinforces revenue opportunity)
- "Post a Job" in navbar (CTAssistant for employers)
- Fewer top-level items (cleaner)
